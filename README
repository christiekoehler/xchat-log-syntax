This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=315

this is a syntax file for xchat log files so those that look at them alot
can read them easier than pure flat uncolored text

the syntax is setup just like what xchat outputs minus the colored nicks option
i hope to add that sometime but it could be a while if at all
